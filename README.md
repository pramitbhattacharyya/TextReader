# TextReader
This is a text reader app. This allows u to take a pic, save it or not according to your wish and then process 
the image to get the text out of it.Tesseract libraries are used here. It also allows u to select image from a directory.
It has a minor problem that the file "eng.traineddata" is to be placed in the directory stated beforehand because 
though codes are written for coping the required file if they are not present but unfortunately it is not working. 
So I need to go through it.
